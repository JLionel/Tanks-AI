# Tank AI
3D top down Tank shooter game with AI
 
## Context
This game has been made for educational purpose during the first year of the Msc Video Game programming in Gaming Campus with the supervision of Matthieu GOLSENNE.  

#### Objective
Learn about AI on Unity.  

#### Technology used
Unity 2020.3  
C#

#### Group
[Flavien MERITTO](https://github.com/Ny0n)  
[Lionel JANIN](https://github.com/JLionel) (me)  
[Killian PEREZ](https://github.com/Meshanda)  

#### Time to realize it
1 month

## Worked On
  * Implement Dijkstra algorithm
  * Implement A* algorithm
  * Add [NavMeshComponents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/NavMeshComponents) usage
  * Added a grid for our algorithms
  * Move the tanks depending of the shortest path algorithm

## Acquired skills
- A*, Dijkstra algorithms
- Navmeshes
- State Machines / Hierarchical State Machines
- Behaviour Trees
- Custom editor with UI Builder (2020.3)
- Environment detection
- Switch between behaviours depending on the context

## Assets
The assets used in this project come from Unity's tank project.
